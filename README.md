<h1 >TRANSLATE SPEECH TO TEXT</h1>
<h3>ðŸ“š Description</h3>
<p>This repository contains a Machine Learning project for converting Speech to Text using Python. It demonstrates how to process audio data, extract meaningful features, and apply speech recognition techniques to accurately transcribe spoken language into written text.</p>

<h3>ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s inside this notebook?</h3>
<p>Loading Audio: Reads audio files in common formats like WAV or MP3.
Preprocessing: Handles noise reduction and prepares the signal for recognition.
Feature Extraction: Extracts key audio features (e.g., MFCCs) using librosa or similar libraries.
Speech Recognition: Uses Pythonâ€™s speech_recognition library to transcribe the audio into text.
Output: Displays the transcribed text and optionally stores it in a file.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used</h3>
<p>speech_recognition â€“ for speech-to-text conversion
pydub â€“ for audio manipulation
librosa â€“ for feature extraction and visualization
matplotlib â€“ for plotting waveforms and spectrograms</p>

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Use Case</h3>
<p>This notebook can be used as a template for building your own speech recognition applications, whether for:
    Voice-controlled systems
    Transcribing recorded lectures or meetings
    Developing assistive technologies
</p>
